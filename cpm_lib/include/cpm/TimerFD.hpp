     * and phase to the clock.
     * This class should be used if a 'simple' timed callback is required. 
     * Whereas Timer.hpp relies on e.g. a parameter server to check if 
     * simulated time is used or not, directly using TimerFD allows to create
     * timed callbacks for methods that use the system clock independent on 
     * the run (real or simulated). This could be GUI tools, periodic tasks etc...
