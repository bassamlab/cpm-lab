 * \struct VehicleCommandDirect
 * \brief Direct control commands that can be sent to the vehicle

 * Uses dimensionless, uncalibrated inputs and applies them directly to the motor and servo.
 * 
 * (motor_throttle ==  1) => Max forward
 * 
 * (motor_throttle ==  0) => Brake to standstill
 * 
 * (motor_throttle == -1) => Max reverse
 * 
 * (steering_servo ==  1) => Max left
 * 
 * (steering_servo ==  0) => Steering roughly centered, but may have an offset
 * 
 * (steering_servo == -1) => Max right
